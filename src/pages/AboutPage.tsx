            Understanding magnetic declination is crucial for accurate navigation with a compass.
          </Text>

          <Text mb="lg">
            Magnetic declination (also called magnetic variation) is the angle between magnetic north (the direction the north end of a compass needle points) and true north (the direction along a meridian towards the geographic North Pole). This angle varies depending on your position on the Earth's surface and changes over time.

          <Text mb="md">
            If you're using a magnetic compass for navigation, you need to adjust for the declination to find true north. Without this adjustment, you could end up significantly off course over long distances.

          <Title order={3} mb="md">How Declination Changes</Title>
          <Text mb="md">
            Earth's magnetic field is not staticâ€”it changes over time due to fluid motion in the Earth's core. This means declination values for any location gradually change year by year.
          </Text>
          <Text mb="xl">
            The World Magnetic Model (WMM) is updated every five years to keep pace with these changes. Our calculator uses the latest model to provide the most accurate declination values.

                  Our calculator uses NOAA's Geomagnetic Calculator API, which implements the World Magnetic Model (WMM). This provides accuracy within 1 degree for most locations. The model is updated every five years to maintain accuracy.

                <Accordion.Panel>
                  If the declination is east (positive), add it to your compass reading to get true north. If the declination is west (negative), subtract its absolute value from your compass reading to get true north.
